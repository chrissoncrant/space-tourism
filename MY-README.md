# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website solution

## The Start
The first thing was setting up the project. This involved:
- Downloading the files and assets
- Setting up an initial project directory and bringing in the assets.
- Going over the Figma design file while taking notes on things that will be challenging (ie the things I know I will have to look up).
- Setup the stylesheet with intial CSS resets, importing fonts, setting up CSS Variables for the colors, setting up certain rules based on the Design System file (font-sizes, character spacings).

## Initial Gameplan
- Mobile-first design. It makes a lot more sense to me to build up to the desktop version than vice versa.
- Define components and look for repeated patterns. 
- I have been wanting to explore Cube CSS methodology created by Andy Bell (see [Resources](#resources)). The best way to explore something like this is to apply it and so that's the plan. 

## The Challenges 
- Creating the hamburger menu. I have done this a few times before, but it has been awhile since the last time.
- Creating the active navigation item styling. This occurs in multiple places in different ways.
